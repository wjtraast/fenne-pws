---

### ⚠️ **PRIORITY 2: Limited External Testing**
**Impact:** Could lose 5-8 points

**Required:** Testing with target audience outside school  

**Quick Fix:**
- Have 3-5 family members/friends test recipes

---

### ⚠️ **PRIORITY 3: Incomplete Sections**
**Impact:** Moderate (2-4 points)

## 🌟 FINAL VERDICT

**This is excellent work with one critical gap.**

**IF** the discussion section is added: **Strong candidate for 9.0+ grade**  
**WITHOUT** discussion section: **Still good (8.5) but missed potential**

The cookbook itself is outstanding - professional, practical, and scientifically sound. The research is thorough. The reflection is mature. The one formal requirement they missed (discussion) is fixable with the template provided.

**Recommendation:** Act quickly on Priority 1 (discussion section), celebrate the strong work, and prepare a confident presentation for February 6th.
